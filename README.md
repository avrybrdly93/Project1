# Project1

This is the master branch.  This is where all of the end-product code belongs.

In this branch, we have the following file structure (subject to change):

```
├── assets
|  ├── css
|  |  └── style.css
|  |  └── Possibly other CSS files for organization
|  ├── img
|     └── Any images used
|  └── javascript
|     └── main.js
|     └── Possibly other CSS files for organization
└── index.html
```

In order to push any files from the practice branch, use a pull request.  This can be done in the browser on Github's website.
    Remember: a pull request is the way to push a non-master branch to the master
    First, we must push the files up to the practice branch.
    In Git bash: (This is something we've done for a while but is nice to have written out)
        1. git add <filename>
        2. git commit -m "comment goes here"
        3. git push
    The specified files should now be pushed onto the practice branch on Github.com.
    After this, we can use a pull request:
        1. Click "Compare & pull request" from the <code> section or "New pull request" from the branches section
        2. Enter a Title and Comment about the proposed pull request.
        3. Ask for a collaborator to review and approve of the pull request.
        4. After accepted, the master branch should now be updated.
        5. $$$

Remember: the goal is to become comfortable with the Github flow, and to utilize it fully to allow us collaborate as a group more easily.
