# Project1

This is the practice branch.  This is where all of the practice code belongs.

In this branch, each group member has their own folder that is to be used for creating code for the project.

Once code has been created and is functioning as intended, send a pull request to the master.  One other group member must be there to review the code before it is merged with the master.  Make sure not to push all files to the master, just the necessary files.

The idea is to have a lot of small commits in the practice branch, and maybe even sub branches from practice. We should have less commits to master but I would still like to have several master commits that we can fall back to in case we mess up somewhere.

Remember: the goal is to become comfortable with the Github flow, and to utilize it fully to allow us collaborate as a group more easily.
